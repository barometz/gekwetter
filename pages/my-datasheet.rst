Hi!  I'm Dominic.  I'm a general tinkerer with an academic focus on
programming embedded and industrial systems.  I'm curious about communication
and education, and by night I occasionally program useful tidbits.

Via email, you can contact me at `gekwetter@baudvine.net
<mailto:gekwetter@baudvine.net>`_ (or `dominic <#>`_ at the same domain).  I
like being useful, so if you have an open source project that needs volunteers
and you think I might be interested, don't hesitate.  If you have a job offer
you think I might be interested in, don't hesitate either.

Experience_
===========

Currently I'm employed in tier 1 tech support, visiting customers at home and
occasionally at work to diagnose and resolve (mostly) software issues.
Occasionally this also involves one-on-one teaching; generally those are the
most interesting appointments.

I used to help out as assisting sysadmin at the free shell network `Anapnea
<http://anapnea.net>`_, starting in its early days back in 2007.  I later took
on development tasks when it became necessary to automate parts of the
registration process and was part of the general staff.

Until the summer of 2014 I managed the website for my choir, `JKL
<http://jongerenkoorsintlucas.nl>`_.  I started out with a full rewrite of the
website's frontend because the original wasn't written for maintainability.

Non-tech activities include a few years as treasurer of the same choir, two
years as a scout leader and several in retail.  They mostly don't line up with
my IT work, but all of them involve and taught me skills that transfer very
well to any collaborative environment.

Education_
==========

.. image:: /datasheet/mortarboard.png
   :class: aside

I am in my third year of the ICT & Technology program at Fontys ICT,
"University of Applied Sciences".  ICT&T covers systems programming as well as
embedded and industrial software, with a little bit of hardware mixed in.  I
chose this partly because of my interests in physics and programming.

For an internship during the fall semester of 2014 I spent five months at
Philips Research, where I was part of a team implementing an upcoming wireless
peripheral standard.  My task in the project was the implementation of the
Media-Agnostic USB standard within the Linux kernel, which was for the full
duration both terrifying and fascinating.

This is not my first attempt at a degree: after high school I spent two years
in applied physics, after which I spent another two years training to be a
high school physics teacher.  For different reasons neither of those worked
out, but those four years weren't a loss: I'm still interested in education
and learned a lot about social interaction and communication in the process.

Projects_
=========

I like myself best when I make something useful.  Here's a selection of things
I've made.

`Flintlock <https://barometz.github.com/flintlock>`_
    Flintlock is a Windows application to talk to Pebble smartwatches. While a
    `set of python scripts <https://github.com/Hexxeh/libpebble>`_ already
    existed, Flintlock was the first convenient GUI-based tool. Flintlock uses
    my own Flint library to handle the underlying Pebble interaction. Many
    thanks to Hexxeh et al for figuring out Pebble's protocols.

    Unfortunately, I stopped development on Flint and Flintlock after my
    Pebble broke and haven't picked it up since.  I've got another project in
    the works to provide similar functionality without having to reconnect the
    Pebble between phone and PC, though.

`Interro <https://github.com/barometz/interro>`_
    Interro is a little Python module that can be used to create dialog trees
    and go through them with a user. Its original purpose was an interactive
    questionnaire with live answer validation for a chatbot, and that is still
    where it fits best.

`Shirk <https://github.com/barometz/shirk>`_    
    Shirk is an IRC bot written in Python using the `Twisted
    <http://twistedmatrix.com/>`_ framework. That's been done before, but
    Shirk aims to be extremely easy to extend. Writing a new plugin that
    responds to a given !command takes about ten lines of code, so you don't
    have to worry about the IRC internals and can just write the functionality
    you want to add. The bot that handles registrations for Anapnea is based
    on Shirk.
    
Interests_
==========

   :class: aside

I enjoy making things, as well as repairing things that are broken.  Despite
my education my soldering iron is usually cold, but I do enjoy working with
wood.  I mostly read fantasy and sci-fi, and have a `to-read list
<https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6967358?shelf=to-read>`_ that isn't
getting any shorter.  I have too much tea in my cupboard.

For years I sang in a choir, and that's still something of a passion.  Music
in general is important to me, and I have more instruments than I can
competently play.  Which is to say that I think I can sing, and I know I'm no
good at the guitar, tin whistle or harmonica.  I listen to `all kinds of music
<http://www.last.fm/user/nazgjunk/charts?rangetype=overall&subtype=artists>`_.
