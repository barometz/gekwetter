# Gekwetter

This is primarily the GitHub backup for my personal website and blog,
Gekwetter, which can be found at http://barometz.name .  Additionally it may
serve to show off my blitzin' config and other assorted trickery.

Gekwetter runs on the [Nikola](http://getnikola.com/) static website/blog
generator.  I build it with the slightly outdated Nikola 7.1 from the Debian
Testing repository because I don't want to pull up a virtualenv just to update
my blog.
