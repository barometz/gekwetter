.. description: Why '?' is not a useful question.
.. type: text

Imagine the following conversation::
      
   <Kate> So it turns out Torchlight II has an Engineer class
   <Bob> ?

Kate said something, and Bob asked a question about it.  Right?  Here's what
Kate said next::

  <Kate> Mostly DPS, with a bunch of technological tricks like spider mines

Actually, no.  What Kate really said was::

  <Kate> Yeah, they're going with four classes that are all different from
         Torchlight I

Or was it::
    
  <Kate> It's a game by Runic Games, a bunch of people there made Diablo II and
         they're making something in the same vein

.. note::
   I'll probably want an example from the real world, or at least something
   about a different topic.  Possibly with some kind of confusion afterwards.
	 
Honestly, Kate doesn't know either.  She only knows Bob from this chat, and
not all that well, so it's hard to tell what Bob is actually asking when he
says "?".

The point here is that **a question mark is not a question**.  It's about
equivalent to a "huh?" in spoken conversation.  If you care about the answer,
you should make the effort to form a question so other people don't have to
spend (as much) time figuring out what you're actually asking for.

Yes, sometimes it can be immediately clear what you mean when you go "?".
Much of the time it isn't, and it's really easy to assume it'll be obvious
when it actually isn't.  The other generally doesn't know how much you know,
or what you're curious about.  They can't look inside your head, so be helpful
and tell them about it!
